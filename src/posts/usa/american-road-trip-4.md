The silver lining of the snowstorm came the next day as the skies cleared up and the unseasonably cold weather kept the crowds away.

The elevation dropped several thousand feet as we continued west, and by early afternoon, most of the snow had disappared. We stopped to walk around the ski resort town of Vail.
