Venice, California was founded in 1905 by a wealthy developer by the name of Abbot Kinney.
After excavating miles of marshes for its namesake Venetian-style canals and constructing beach cabins with sunset views of the Santa Monica mountains, the area went from smelly backwater to the hottest tourist attraction on the West Coast.

In 1929, oil was discovered in Los Angeles, and the pollution spewing from hundreds of wells took a heavy toll on the resort town. Drilling waste clogged the canals. The cost of maintenance became prohibitive. Many of the waterways were paved over, and the town went through a period of neglect.

Following the war, low rents for run-down beachside bungalows attracted beatniks, hippies, and other eccentrics, and the city reclaimed its status as a quirky tourist attraction, all while remaining relatively affordable.

Then, following the 2008 mortgage crisis, the Southern California housing market exploded. Rents in Venice doubled over the course of 10 years and have grown at an even faster clip following the pandemic. Homeless people all over Los Angeles County flocked to Venice, drawn by a combination of pleasant weather, proximity to the beach, and, of course, a live-and-let-live culture that allowed drug addicts to consume freely. Of course, they aren't allowed to wander into the view of tourists.

Just across the street from the entrance to the canals is a small encampment, partially pictured below. As I took the picture, a grotesque barrage of coughing and hacking came from the direction of the tent; upon closer inspection, the sound came from a man collapsed on the sidewalk behind the tent, limbs akimbo and emitting a constant, low moan. He was ferociously drunk and began swearing at me when I glanced in his direction.

Trash-covered streets and sidewalks that smell of urine.

Immaculately manicured Indian laurel fig trees provide shade for tents.
I don't actually know anything about trees, but the city of Los Angeles documents every tree in the city <a href="https://losangelesca.treekeepersoftware.com/index.cfm">in a publicly accessible map</a>, which is really neat.

At the Google office where I work, private security keeps a wary eye on the dozens of tents and broken-down vans surrounding the campus, which is girded by a ten-foot-tall chain link fence. In every building that isn’t completely fenced off, windows are plastered with warnings to “keep these closed for everyone’s safety.”

This popular brunch spot charges $25 for an eggs benedict. (It's really good, though.)

The most expensive grocery store in America, with a juice bar that starts at $19.

No place better exemplifies California’s inequalities and contradictions.
