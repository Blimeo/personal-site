**Day 9: Glenwood Springs, CO -> Moab, UT**

</div>

As we continued west, lush mountains gave way to craggy, arid hills.

After grabbing a quick lunch in town (which has a surprising abundance of good food options), we went to the nearby Canyonlands National Park.

It's worth checking out if you're in the area but doesn't hold a candle to the Grand Canyon, to be honest.

**Day 10: Moab, UT**

</div>

Arches National Park, the highlight of the Moab area, had implemented a timed entry system to distribute the entry of visitors more evenly throughout the day, so we couldn't get in until mid-afternoon, but that left us plenty of time to explore every nook and cranny of the less-trafficked Devil's Garden Trailhead.

**Day 11: Moab, UT -> Springdale, UT**

</div>

I have an unwise zeal for drinking untreated water as long as it looks clean. After doing so in Vail three days prior, I began suffering the consequences today and spent the whole day downing Pepto-Bismol.

The original plan was to hike several trails around Bryce Canyon, famous for its <a href="<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_(geology">hoodoo</a>>) formations, but I could only make it 50 feet out from the trailhead to get this picture before retreating to the porcelain throne.

**Day 12: Springdale, UT -> Las Vegas, NV**

</div>

We didn't spend much time in Zion due to extreme heat, but the main road through the park was nice enough.

After arriving in Vegas, we needed a respite from our week of burgers, and made a beeline for Chinatown, where the food options were more varied and delicious than all the previous week's towns and cities combined. With a bowl of pho, my stomach illness seemed to disappear.
