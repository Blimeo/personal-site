**Time of Visit: April 2022**

Every time I visit San Francisco, my love for the city increases. It continually amazes me how a city of less than a million people is home to some of the best architecture, nature, weather, and food in the country and maintains such an outsize influence on the rest of the world.

I went with my girlfriend on a warm (by SF standards) Saturday afternoon and had brunch at a wonderful restaurant called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/t2i9qpFFAbwg1xwz7">Jamie's Place</a> that serves simple but well-executed American breakfast with a Chinese twist, though you wouldn't know it by looking at the menu. Their pancakes have a crepe-like savoriness, and their omelettes are stir-fried with Chinese-style ground pork bits. It's now my favorite brunch place in the Bay.

After eating brunch, we walked north on 9th Avenue towards Golden Gate Park, which is confusingly not located adjacent to the Golden Gate Bridge.

Golden Gate Park is a huge expanse of green space with museums, gardens, statues, memorials, picnic areas, and sports fields that one could spend a full two days exploring, but we were here to visit the California Academy of Sciences.

The California Academy of Sciences is supposed to be a kids' science museum. But I think kids and
adults alike treat it as a zoo. There's an indoor rainforest complete with exotic butterflies and
macaws, an underground aquarium, and a penguin exhibit.
