**Day 3: Toledo -> Chicago**

</div>

The road from Toledo to Chicago was profoundly mind-numbing, mostly speeding through decaying Rust Belt cities. But there are some gems in the rough. About halfway between Toledo and Chicago, located in rural Indiana, was the beautifully maintained Krider World's Fair Garden.

Our first meal in Chicago, was, of course, the Chicago dog.

We took the train from Wicker Park to downtown, near the waterfront.

Chicago is, by far, the cleanest large city in the US. There is some interesting historical background for this: according to our Uber driver, a fire in 1871 burned the city to the ground and the city was rebuilt with alleys for every building, which are now used for trash cans, keeping rubbish and foul odors far from the sidewalks.

I think I have a new favoite American city.
