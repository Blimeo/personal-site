_Time of Visit: May 2022_

After finishing my last college exam, I embarked on a road trip from New Jersey to Los Angeles.

Heading west on Interstate 76, we stopped at a small town called Mcconnelsburg. It used to be a rest
stop going west from DC by horseback, but nowadays it's a little too far from the interstate and has
faded into a sleepy little town.

Pittsburgh felt like a little oasis of civilization after five hours of farmland.

**Day 2: Pittsburgh, PA -> Toledo, OH**

After driving about 2 hours from Pittsburgh, we stopped in an artsy, residential neighborhood of Cleveland called Tremont for brunch. After driving through the rest of Cleveland, we realized that it might be best neighborhood in the whole city.

Driving about 15 minutes to the northeast through decaying factories, blighted industrial zones and boarded-up homes, we arrived at the Cleveland Museum of Art, right next to the Case Western University campus.

We got some bread, cheese, and pastrami from West Side Market to make some sandwiches for dinner. West Side Market is a historic market complex with tons of stands selling meat, cheese, produce, and a variety of artisan ready-to-eat foods at relatively affordable prices.

Driving about 2 hours west towards Toledo brought us to Maumee Bay State Park, where we picnicked overlooking Lake Erie.
