**Time of Visit: January 2022**

Just beyond the southern city limits of Berkeley lies the Oakland neighborhood of Rockridge. A far cry from the anarchic images that Oakland conjures in locals' minds, Rockridge is a peaceful, walkable suburb mainly inhabited by young families and worldly retired folk.

I came mostly because of this incendiary New York Times article entitled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/08/dining/best-bagels.html#commentsContainer">"The Best Bagels Are in California (Sorry, New York)"</a> which accumulated 1600 comments from enraged New Yorkers. Anyway, the article used Boichik Bagels, a bagel shop in Rockridge, to defend their claim.

I forgot to take a picture of the bagel itself, but the taste was only okay and the value terrible at \$3 for a plain bagel. Any New Jerseyan would walk out of the store seeing half that price, but at Boichik I had to wait in a 15-minute line for the privilege of buying a mediocre \$3 bagel. I didn't want the disappointing bagel to define my experience in the neighborhood, so I decided to take a walk around.

I've noticed that neighborhoods like these (i.e. wealthy, walkable, commercial areas) in America tend to lack the businesses necessary for everyday life. Florists, stationery stores, and antique stores are great for visitors and lazy Sunday mornings, but how about the unsexy everyday things? Where are the drugstores, hardware stores, and shipping centers? Surely the average resident in the area would benefit from the convenience. I guarantee you that not one person has ever said to themselves, "Thank God I live just three blocks away from a Steinway retail store."

Many young Asian-American chefs in the Bay Area flock to San Francisco and Oakland to open small stores and pop-ups, often after working their way up from successful Instagram-based shops. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QsZSosEY2WH3xPRo8">Sunday Bakeshop</a> is a prime example of this, serving up croissiants, cruffins, and buns flavored with ingredients like matcha, ube, and red bean.

I ordered a croissiant and the girl working there was kind enough to throw in a delicious melon bun for free.

A pleasant way to spend an afternoon amidst the cool breeze, blue skies, and warm sunshine.
