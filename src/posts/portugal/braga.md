_Time of Visit: October 15-17, 2022_

The northern Portuguese city of Braga rarely appears in any tourist itinerary. It's the third-largest city in the country, but with just 193,000 inhabitants, it's dwarfed by nearby Porto (pop. 1.6 million) and Lisbon (pop. 2.7 million). The Schengen Zone allowed me to take a hassle-free bus ride from Vigo in neighboring Spain.

I arrived around 4 in the afternoon and walked from the bus station to my hotel in the old city. The residential and commercial buildings outside the city center are similar to those in Spain except older, uglier, and dirtier.

The old city, on the other hand, is refreshingly colorful, in stark contrast to the dull stone
buildings that dominate the historic quarters of Galician cities. As a bonus, it is also partially
pedestrianized, a rarity in car-crazy Portugal.

Vivid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azulejo">azulejo</a> facades adorn building exteriors throughout the
city. Production of these ceramic tiles was once widespread throughout the whole Iberian peninsula, centered
in Seville, but they fell out of style in Spain, leaving Portugal to pick up the slack. Today, it is
perhaps the most iconic element of Portuguese architecture.

Mass tourism has yet to fully sanitize the city center: Boutique hotels and 50-euro restaurants with English-only menus sit next to dingy cafes with a single incandescent bulb.

Signs of Portugal's poverty leak through the pretty facades of the old city. New construction is
100% functional concrete with almost no detail or ornamentation, while old buildings outside the
main tourist drag are left to rot. Landmarks are gate-kept with steep entrance fees but contain
cursory, poorly-translated explanations.

One effect of the colonization of Brazil was the democratization of sugar in Portugal. Once a luxury
good, sugar was now abundant and cheap thanks to slave labor on the other side of the Atlantic, making
pastry shops as commercially viable as normal bakeries, and it's not too hard to guess which one won;
every Portuguese village has a pastry shop, while humble boulangeries are few and far between. Remarkably,
the country maintains one of the lowest obesity rates in Europe, lower than the likes of France, Germany,
and Norway.

It is only a slight exaggeration to say that pastries more or less function as a substitute for bread
in Portugal. They are often paired with a coffee for breakfast or simply eaten as a snack.

The next day, I walked through the eastern suburbs of Braga to the Catholic shrine of Bom Jesus do Monte.
The suburbs looked more like Brazil or Bulgaria than they did a western European city.

Portugal is a strange place where residents enjoy first-world amenities like quality education, healthcare,
and transport, but the run-down, haphazard urban environment resembles that of a developing country.
If America is a third-world country with a Gucci belt, Portugal is a first-world country with an Adidas
tracksuit.

Bom Jesus do Monte is located on a hilltop. You can take a funicular railway to the top, but I ate too
many sweets for breakfast so I decided to walk the 25 flights of stairs or so.

Humans are quite incredible. We can ignore the physical world around us, going against a million years
of evolution, and, in a moment of pious delirium, see things like [crying stone statues of the Virgin
Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeping_statue). And then, when we sober up, we don't think to ourselves,
"well, that was stupid of me" - instead, we remake the world in our vision.

The hill around the monastery has been converted into a park, complete with an artificial lake,
kayak rentals, and barbecue pits. Locals grilled meat and paddled around in spite of the relentless
drizzle.

/>I had sushi for dinner. The two guys behind the counter were high school buddies from Sao Paulo who
had cooked at Japanese restaurants back at home in Brazil and immigrated to Braga after completing some
online accounting certifications that fast-tracked their visas. Life was great in Portugal, they said,
because it felt like home except without people robbing them at gunpoint every month.{' '}
