_Time of Visit: October 9, 2022_

I had planned for today to be my longest day of walking, with nearly 35km between the towns of Palas de Rei and Arzua. Some people opt to take it easy and rest in the town of Melide in between, but the town didn't seem particularly interesting so I decided to follow the canonical route. Plus, my legs had gotten used to long distances, so I felt up to the challenge.

Morning walks in rural Galicia are a veritable assault on the nostrils. Livestock, grass, and fertilizer
create a potent odor that is compounded by the dense mist, and being outside is akin to standing in a
shower fart that won't dissipate. A farmer's boy from North Dakota told me the smell made him miss home,
as if I needed any more reasons to not visit North Dakota.

The terrain was quite flat, so I made steady progress and reached the midpoint town of Melide by midday.
I stopped for a chocolate croissant and latte and chatted with a Finnish forestry engineer. He told me
he had inquired unsuccessfully about saunas in every town for 32 days straight but that he had finally
booked a Finnish-style sauna in Arzua and was incredibly excited about it. You really can't make this
stuff up.

The villages appeared increasingly wealthy and well-maintained as I closed in on Santiago de Compostela.
No doubt that these places benefit greatly from locals looking to escape to the countryside for a weekend
or holiday. Indeed, zoom into the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.9259931,-8.0966937,3008m/data=!3m1!1e3">houses west of Melide on Google Maps</a>and the area is actually quite heavily forested - less barns and more pools and _casas rurales_.

With 5km to go, the road descended 200m into a valley and climbed back up the other side, delivering
me to the brink of death. The only thing that kept me going was an [amazing-looking Italian
restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/NJZrEU3Jv6wdC4iG7) in Arzua I had found on Google Maps.

Galicia has incredible tourism potential - they've got scenery, infrastructure, culture, and history.
All they need to do is lure a bunch of Italians to open restaurants throughout the countryside and the
whole province would become a climate-change-proof alternative to Tuscany.

song of the day: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4tVK80paOI">Kettel - Purple Jacket Trot</a> - sentimental IDM that helped me through some tough times in high school. Kettel has an absolutely incredible ear for melody.
